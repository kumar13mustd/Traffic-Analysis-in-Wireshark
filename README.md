# Traffic-Analysis-in-Wireshark

My name is Challa Mohan Kumar do the traffic analysis in wireshark dated as 27th Oct 2025

I used Wireshark to watch the data going in and out of my computer.
First, I started Wireshark and began capturing packets on my Wi-Fi.
Then I opened some websites to create internet traffic.
After a minute, I stopped the capture and used filters like http, dns, and tcp to see different types of packets.

I found many protocols such as DNS, TCP, and HTTP.
1. DNS - Used to resolve domain names
2. TCP - Handles reliable data transfer
3. HTTP - Used for web communication

This task helped me learn how network packets work and how to use Wireshark for checking internet traffic.
